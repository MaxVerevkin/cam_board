# Abstract

Some markdown was sauced from various websites.

First section
=============

This is some text in the first section.
...
And this is some more text.

Importing modules is done via:

```python
import sys
import time
```


Code fragments can be split into multiple parts
\[example.py @ 28 , example.py @ 60\] 
:

```python
a = 1
b = 2
#...
time.sleep(int(sys.argv[1]))
```

# NEW SECTION
## Subsection
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Wait for it...

. . .

This text only appears on the next slide (\ref{aaa}).
This is some math $\frac{1}{2}$
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}}
\label{aaa}
\end{equation}

Second section
==============

This is the second section.
And this is the second part of the second sectinon.
\[example.py @ 77\] 

```python
if(__name__ == "__main__"):
```
