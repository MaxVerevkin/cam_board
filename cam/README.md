# aruco_cam

- prepare paper with 4 aruco symbols arranged 
  - example for a 19/9 aspect ratio camera is in qr_codes/a4_aruco_small.svg
- small circle is in the upper left corner
- aruco codes are inside a rectangle with side aspect ration equal to the camera aspect ratio 
  - in qr_codes/a4_aruco_small.svg this is 16/9
  - carefull, each symbol has to have the right orientation (might need to be rotated)
